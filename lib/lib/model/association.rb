      # * collection(force_load = false) -- Returns an array of all the associated
      #   objects. An empty array is returned if none are found.
      #
      # * collection<<(object, ...) -- Adds one or more objects to the collection by
      #   setting their foreign keys to the collectionâ€˜s primary key.
      #
      # * collection.delete(object, ...) -- Removes one or more objects from the
      #   collection by removing the association between objects.
      #
      # * collection=objects -- Replaces the collections content by deleting and
      #   adding objects as appropriate.
      #
      # * collection.clear -- Removes every object from the collection.
      #
      # * collection.empty? -- Returns true if there are no associated objects.
      #
      # * collection.size -- Returns the number of associated objects.
